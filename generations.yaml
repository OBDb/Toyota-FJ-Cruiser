    description: "The Toyota FJ Cruiser represented a nostalgic yet thoroughly modern take on Toyota's legendary FJ40 Land Cruiser, combining retro styling cues with contemporary engineering for serious off-road capability. Built on a modified version of the 120-series Land Cruiser Prado/4Runner platform, the FJ Cruiser featured distinctive retro-inspired styling with a short, boxy profile, white roof, wrap-around rear windows, and round headlights flanking a 'TOYOTA' branded grilleâ€”all clear homages to the iconic FJ40. The unusual body configuration featured rear-hinged half doors providing access to the rear seats, similar to extended cab pickup trucks. Powered by a 4.0-liter V6 producing 239 horsepower (later increased to 260 horsepower) and 278 lb-ft of torque, the FJ Cruiser was available with either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case, the latter featuring either a five-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission with a locking rear differential. Off-road credentials were impressive with 9.6 inches of ground clearance, 34-degree approach and 31-degree departure angles, and available features like Active Traction Control (A-TRAC) and Crawl Control on some variants. The interior emphasized durability with water-resistant materials, rubber flooring, and drain plugs for easy cleaning, though with modern amenities including an available premium JBL audio system, power accessories, and cruise control. Throughout its production run, the FJ Cruiser received minor updates including improved engines, additional convenience features, and special editions like the Trail Teams models with enhanced off-road equipment. Despite its niche appeal and relatively short production run in North America (continuing longer in other markets like the Middle East and Australia), the FJ Cruiser developed a devoted following and strong resale values due to its unique character, genuine capability, and Toyota's reputation for reliability, representing one of the more successful retro-themed vehicle designs of its era."
